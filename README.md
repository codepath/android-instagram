# android-instagram

## Overview

This is the starter project for the Instagram Client Project. 

## What's Included
* <tt>com.codepath.instagram.models</tt> => We've built out the models so you can work directly with post, user, and image objects instead of having to deal with json.
* <tt>com.codepath.instagram.helpers</tt> => Here you can find helpful classes / methods that will come in useful throughout the project. These will be referenced when they are needed.
* <tt>com.codepath.instagram.persistence</tt> => This is where we've provided some constant definitions for use in the persistence story.
* <tt>Drawables</tt> => Don't worry about searching for images that will look good. We've already provided a majority of the assets you'll need.
* <tt>Colors</tt> => We've included some of the colors (in <tt>colors.xml</tt>) that you'll need. You'll noticed that the mocks will refer to the color name instead of the hex value.
* <tt>Dependencies</tt> => We've pulled in the dependencies you need (with the correct versions) into <tt>build.gradle</tt> so you can skip this step when you come across it in the guides. These include [Fresco](https://github.com/facebook/fresco), [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html), and [android-async-http](http://loopj.com/android-async-http/).

## Finished Project
* By the end of the project, you will have built something that looks like the following:
